MATH261A-project-template
Example project repository for MATH 261A at San Jos√© State University.

Project Overview
This repository documents a full data analysis project conducted for the MATH 261A course. The main goal is to apply statistical and data science techniques (e.g., regression, modeling, prediction) to a real-world dataset, communicate results through reproducible analysis, and write a report following academic standards.

Data
Source:
Data used in this project is obtained from San Francisco Open Data, provided under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License.

Description:
The dataset covers [briefly describe the topic, e.g. "energy usage trends", "crime incidents", "property assessment records", etc.].
Any necessary preprocessing, cleaning, or transformation steps will be described in the analysis section.

Analysis
All statistical analysis and visualizations will be performed in R, organized in the /analysis folder.
Methods include regression modeling, exploratory data analysis, and reproducible code practices (with scripts and R Markdown files).

Report
The final report is written using Quarto (see /paper folder).
References are managed with BibTeX; citations and bibliography are included using a .bib file.

External Resources
Statement:
The final report and code were written by Lasya Ramachandruni, with support from valuable external resources and tools referenced throughout the project.

LLM-based chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT Edu) for coding and explanations

Online forums (e.g., Stack Overflow, RStudio Community) for troubleshooting

Academic literature and data documentation for methodological grounding

R, RStudio, and version control via Git/GitHub

How to Run
Open the project in RStudio (MATH261A-project-template.Rproj)

Install required R packages from the setup script or README instructions.

Run analysis scripts from /analysis/.

Compile the report using Quarto in /paper/.
